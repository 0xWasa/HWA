///         (`pool.setUint(FWAConfigKeys.SURCHARGE_BPS, 1200)`). Constants live in a library so they inline
///         at zero bytecode cost in both FWA and its callers. Values are globally unique across all three
///         dispatchers so the emitted `ConfigSet(key, value)` event is unambiguous for indexers.
